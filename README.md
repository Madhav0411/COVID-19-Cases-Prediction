# Coronavirus (COVID-19) Visualization & Prediction

This project focuses on the visualization and prediction of COVID-19 cases worldwide. It utilizes data from Johns Hopkins University to provide insights into the ongoing pandemic.

## Introduction
Coronavirus, also known as SARS-CoV-2, is a highly contagious respiratory virus that emerged in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization officially designated the disease caused by this virus as COVID-19 on 2/11/2020. This notebook aims to explore COVID-19 through data analysis and projections.

## Data Source
Coronavirus case data is provided by [Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).

## Contents
- [Exploring Global Coronavirus Cases](#world_wide_graphs)
- [Exploring Coronavirus Cases From Different Countries](#country_graphs)
- [Worldwide Confirmed Cases Prediction](#prediction)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, scikit-learn

## Overview of Sections

### Exploring Global Coronavirus Cases
This section visualizes the number of confirmed cases, daily increases, and mortality rate (CFR) worldwide.

### Exploring Coronavirus Cases From Different Countries
Visualizations are provided for specific countries to examine COVID-19 at a more localized level. The top 10 countries with the most confirmed cases are initially displayed, followed by a comparison of selected countries.

### Worldwide Confirmed Cases Prediction
Three prediction models are utilized to forecast future confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide:
1. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
2. Polynomial Regression
3. Bayesian Ridge Regression

## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter notebook to execute the code.
2. Ensure the required dependencies are installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
3. Update the data source regularly for up-to-date predictions.
4. Customize the countries for visualization as needed.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement additional prediction models for comparison.
- Enhance visualization with interactive features.
- Include geographical mapping of COVID-19 cases.
